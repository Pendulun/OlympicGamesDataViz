# OlympicGamesDataViz

This is the final project for the Data Visualization class at UFMG. The dataset can be seen at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).

The code for the visualizations can be seen at the interactiveViz folder. It was done using Plotly and Dash. The final result is hosted at [Heroku](https://olympic-games-data-viz.herokuapp.com/). You can run it locally with Dash by running the interactiveViz/app.py file.
